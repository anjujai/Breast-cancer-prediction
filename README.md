# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using features from breast cancer biopsy data.

## Algorithms Used:
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for binary classification.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A model that finds the optimal hyperplane for classifying the data.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem for classification.
- **Decision Tree**: A tree-based model that splits data based on feature values to make decisions.

## Dataset:
The dataset consists of several features extracted from breast cancer biopsies:
- Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Compactness, Symmetry, etc.
- The target variable is binary: **Malignant (1)** or **Benign (0)**.

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to apply and compare different machine learning models to accurately predict breast cancer tumor classifications.

## Results:
The models were evaluated using **accuracy** as the primary metric. Logistic Regression and SVM performed the best in this case.
